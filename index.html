        <p>Mandy was lucky as she and her mother lived with her grandparents
            and she liked nothing better than to spend time with her grandfather.
            You see, he was always making something and she enjoyed watching,
            learning, and sometimes even helping him finish whatever he was doing.
            “Grandfather, what are you building in your workshop today?” Mandy asked. She giggled as she said, “It looks like you’re playing with two long sticks.” “Well Mandy,” he said.</p>

 <h1>Do You Wonder About</h1>
<h3>Rain,Snow,Sleel,and Hail</h3>
<br>
<p>Hi, I am Professor Mois Ture and I will be telling you about water.
    You can call it RAIN. You can call it SNOW. You can call it SLEET. You can call it HAIL. But it’s WATER all the same. Did you ever wonder how old water is or where it comes from? The answers may surprise you.
    Oops,!…the sun is out! But don’t worry, Professor Mois Ture will return.
After all, I am a part of the Water Cycle. Evaporation - Condensation- Precipitation - CollectionCollection No matter how it comes down, it is collected and stored. It can fall into the ocean, lake, pond, river, or stream. If it lands on the ground, it may roll into a river or be sucked up by the soil. It may even pass through the ground to an underground lake or river to be used later.
